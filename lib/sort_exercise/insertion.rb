# Implement Insertion Sort

# Implement in a module; always think in modules!
# We turn the methods into module methods by prepending "self." on the
# method name.

    def self.loop_sort!(a)
      raise "not an array" unless a.kind_of?(Array)
      return a if a.size < 2    # handles nil and 1 element arrays

      a.each_with_index do |element, index|
        hole = (index - 1)        # this starts us looking for a hole
        # for the element we're comparing  to
        # fit into.

    # A recursive implmentation of the same insertion sort
    # This method actually requires two levels of recursion:
    # * 1 for the outer "each" loop to go through the entire array
    # * 2 for the inner "while" loop to find the hole
    # recursive_sort! fulfills the first need, while insert_into_hole
    # fulfills the second need.
    #
    # recursive_sort! is a public method, as it is what gets called from
    # the main program, and what we use to test with.

      # The first time recursive_sort! is called, the first and last
      # parameters are omitted, and get set at the beginning; this makes
      # calling the method a very clean "recursive_sort!(my_array)".

    # loop for the insertion sort. It is declared private so it can't be
    # invoked inadvertently.
